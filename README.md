## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

The biggest challenge was creating an HTML that would allow me to transition from mobile-first to desktop without too many headaches. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, and as a result, I had to resort to certain 'workarounds' to adjust the layout.

### Useful resources

- [The 7-1 Pattern](https://www.educative.io/courses/sass-for-css/the-7-1-pattern) - This article helped me a lot to organize my Sass folders.
